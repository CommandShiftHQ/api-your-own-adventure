    <h1>Introduction to APIs</h1>
    <p>
      In this session, we are going to learn how to use Postman to interact with an API over HTTP.
    </p>
    <h2>Installing Postman</h2>
    <p>
      Postman is a REST client, it allows us to interact with an API by building HTTP requests. This is very handy when
      we are building an API, or are learning how a new one works. One way to think of it is a web browser that doesn't
      render the web page.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Download postman here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find details of the interface <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/navigating-postman/">here</a>. We also recommend you read the next page <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/sending-the-first-request/">sending your first request</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      We will be using this [api](https://github.com/MCRcodes/api-your-own-adventure) to get used to sending <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests. The aim is to explore the cave and find the treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this, you will need to send a <code>GET</code> request to receive a description of your current location and available choices, then send a <code>POST</code> request with a choice to the same url. You will then receive the url for the next part of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you're ready, send a <code>GET</code> request to <code>https://api-you-own-adventure.herokuapp.com/location/start</code>. You should receive this <code>JSON</code> response:
    </p>
    <code>
      {<br>
        "text":"Welcome adventurer. Your adventure begins, as many do, in Ye Olde Inn.",<br>
        "choices":["Continue"]<br>
      }
    </code>

    <h2>Sending your first <code>POST</code> request</h2>
    <p>
      Now we have the first part of the story, we need to build a <code>POST</code> request to move the story forward. To do this, you will need to:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set the request type next to the url bar as <code>POST</code>, the url will remain the same.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click on the <code>body</code> tab, select the <code>raw</code> option. A dropdown menu will appear to the right, it will be set to <code>Text</code> by default. Set it to <code>JSON</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        We now need to write the request body, you may have guessed that it needs to be in <code>JSON</code>, it should look something like this:
        <br>
        <br>
        <code>
          {<br>
            "choice": "YOUR ANSWER HERE"<br>
          }
        </code>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <img src="images/Screenshot 2021-04-22 at 21.36.04.png" alt="">
      <p>
        Once that's in place you should be good to send your first <code>POST</code> request.If it worked, you'll get a response with a <code>goTo</code> property. This will contain the path of the next location. Hit that with a <code>GET</code> request to find out what's in the next location.
      </p>
      <img src="images/Screenshot 2021-04-22 at 21.37.21.png" alt="">
      <p>
        Make a <code>GET</code> request to <code>/location/inn</code> to get the next part of the story. You now have all the skills you need to explore the cave an find the treasure!
